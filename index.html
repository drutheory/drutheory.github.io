    <p>A computer program is a collection of instructions[1] that performs a specific 
       task when executed by a computer. A computer requires programs to function. 
       A computer program is usually written by a computer programmer in a programming
       language. From the program in its human-readable form of source code, a compiler 
       can derive machine codeâ€”a form consisting of instructions that the computer can 
       directly execute. Alternatively, a computer program may be executed with the aid 
       of an interpreter.</p></center>
